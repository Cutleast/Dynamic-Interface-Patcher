# Please Note!!!

**I take no responsibility for any problems that may occur or any assets that get redistributed without permission!**

# Description

This is a dynamic patching tool for ui mods with strict permissions like RaceMenu or MiniMap.
**No assets or files by the original mod authors get redistributed! Patching takes place exclusively locally and redistribution of the patched files is strictly prohibited according to the respective permissions.**
The tool requires a compatible patch to work. Those can be found on the Skyrim nexus on Nexus Mods by searching for something like "DIP Patch".
More info on creating patches can be found in the [documentation](./DOCUMENTATION.md).

# Features

- Fully automated patching
- Automatic extraction of BSA
- Can be installed as a mod in MO2 or Vortex
- Commandline arguments for auto patching

# Official Patches
